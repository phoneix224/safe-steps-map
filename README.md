<h3>🧭 PathFinder</h3>

PathFinder helps you retrace your exact steps when you’re lost in villages or unfamiliar places — something Google Maps doesn’t do.

While maps show destinations, PathFinder remembers where you actually walked.

<h3>🌾 Why PathFinder Exists</h3>

Google Maps works great in cities.
In villages and rural areas, it often fails because:

Roads aren’t mapped correctly

Paths don’t have names

There’s no way to retrace your own route

<h3>PathFinder solves that gap.</h3>

🔍 What Makes It Different

👣 Records your real walking path

🔁 Lets you follow the same path back

📍 No need for road names or directions

🌐 Designed for villages & unmapped areas

Your footsteps become the map.

<h3>🎯 Core Idea</h3>

If you can walk it, you can walk back.
PathFinder makes sure you never lose that path
