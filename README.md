🧭 PathFinder

PathFinder helps you retrace your exact steps when you’re lost in villages or unfamiliar places — something Google Maps doesn’t do.

While maps show destinations, PathFinder remembers where you actually walked.

🌾 Why PathFinder Exists

Google Maps works great in cities.
In villages and rural areas, it often fails because:

Roads aren’t mapped correctly

Paths don’t have names

There’s no way to retrace your own route

PathFinder solves that gap.

🔍 What Makes It Different

👣 Records your real walking path

🔁 Lets you follow the same path back

📍 No need for road names or directions

🌐 Designed for villages & unmapped areas

Your footsteps become the map.

🎯 Core Idea

If you can walk it, you can walk back.
PathFinder makes sure you never lose that path.omain](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain#custom-domain)
